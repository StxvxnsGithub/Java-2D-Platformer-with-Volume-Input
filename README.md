## About

This is a side-scrolling 2D platformer created with IntelliJ IDEA and written in Java. The program uses the CityEngine40 library and mp3spi, the latter of which requires: jlayer, junit and tritonus dependencies. Libraries have been included in the 'libraries' folder. Thoroughly tested on MacOS but may exhibit visual discrepancies on Windows.
